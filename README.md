# Practicum US
Projects I worked on during my study at Practicum.
## Externships
| Project | Description | Libraries  |
|:- |:- |:- |
|[Music valence prediction](https://github.com/WanomiR/practicum/tree/main/Externship%20projects/Music%20valence%20prediction)|…TBD|*librosa, …*|

## Data Science
| Project | Description | Libraries  |
|:- |:- |:- |
|[Telecom churn prediction](https://github.com/WanomiR/practicum/blob/main/DS%20projects/Telecom%20.../telecom-churn-prediction.ipynb)| Via EDA, discovered patterns in customers’ behavior and dependencies between contract options and charges. Preprocessed data for training and tried several ML models. Used oversampling pipeline to avoid target leakage during parameter grid search. Determined the factors that affect churn. |*tensorflow keras, catboost, sklearn, imblearn, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy*|

## Data Analysis
| Project | Description | Libraries  |
|:- |:- |:- |
|[Phone plans analyzis](https://github.com/WanomiR/practicum/blob/main/DA%20projects/Phone%20plans%20analyzis/phone-plans-analyzis.ipynb)| Preprocessed and merged data from several datasets. Used data aggregation and custom functions to calculate revenue. On histograms, showed the difference in plans and users' behavior. Ran statistical tests to validate findings. | *scipy, matplotlib, pandas, numpy* |
